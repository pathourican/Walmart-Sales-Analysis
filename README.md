# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. It utilizes Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Project Steps

   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)

   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.

### Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up table in PostgreSQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.

## Results and Insights

This section will include your analysis findings:
- **Sales Insights**: Key categories, branches with highest sales, and preferred payment methods.
- **Profitability**: Insights into the most profitable product categories and locations.
- **Customer Behavior**: Trends in ratings, payment preferences, and peak shopping hours.

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions to this project:
- Integration with a dashboard tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive visualization.
- Additional data sources to enhance analysis depth.
- Automation of the data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and analysis.
